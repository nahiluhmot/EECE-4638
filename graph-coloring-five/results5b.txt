For this final iteration of the graph coloring problem, we used the greedy solution and another random solution,
plus steepest descent to find our solutions.
We first find a solution using the greedy or the random coloring.
Then we apply 2-opt or 3-opt by removing two or three of the colors from the nodes and trying all possible colors and seeing which one fits the best.
We then compare the number of conflicts of the graphs and take the one with the least and declare that one the best solution.
The results show that it doesn't really seem to work well for this problem.
The greedy solution that we're using tends to find the graph with almost the least number of conflicts.
A way to make this better would be to change the problem from minimizing the number of conflicts and limiting the colors,
to minimizing the number of colors used.
