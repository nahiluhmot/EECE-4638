For this final iteration of the knapsack problem, we used a greedy solution and another random solution,
plus steepest descent to find our solutions.
We first find a solution using the greedy or a random knapsack.
Then we apply 2-opt or 3-opt by removing two or three of the items from the knapsack, and then trying all the remaining items to maximize the value within the limit.
The knapsack with the highest value wins.
We tended to notice that greedy worked for the smaller examples that were more concrete, but the random algorithm worked better for the larger solutions.
